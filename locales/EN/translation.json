            "content": "Medical Caregivers LLC was founded by Robert Ivan Rodriguez, a nurse with specialty in Respiratory Therapy and Physical Rehabilitation. Ivan, as his family and students know him, personally experienced the challenges of healthcare because of his dear mother Sara's ongoing battle with dementia. Ivan felt that care and compassion are an integral part of treatment. Inspired to use his experience to help others, Ivan combined his knowledge in healthcare and passion for showing care to individual patients in order to help others navigate through this challenging time. When he is not working, Robert Ivan maintains his fitness through Martial Arts. He is a Martial Arts Instructor who holds black belts in Judo,  Kendo,  Iaido,  Taekwondo WTF,  and Kung Fu Southern style. All these disciplines have instilled in Ivan the moral values, integrity, patience, perspective, and respect for all living things.  He applies these values in his approach to clients' needs. At Medical Caregivers LLC, we are constantly asking ourselves how we can do more and make a greater difference in someone's life, and that starts with treating every patient we meet with COMPASSION, HONOR, and DIGNITY.  Let's work together and help patients achieve their goals, as well as providing them lasting memories!"
